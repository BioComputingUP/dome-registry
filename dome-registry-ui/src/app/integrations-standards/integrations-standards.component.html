    <h1>Integrations & Standards</h1>
    <p>
      The DOME Registry leverages and integrates with several key external services and international standards to enhance its functionality, interoperability, and alignment with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). This ensures that the DOME Registry operates effectively within the broader scientific data ecosystem.

      <p><strong>What it is:</strong> ORCID provides a persistent digital identifier (ORCID iD) for researchers, used widely for attribution and authentication in scholarly communication.</p>
      <p><strong>How DOME integrates:</strong> User authentication for the main DOME Registry front-end website (e.g., for journals managing submissions) is handled via ORCID Sign-In. This links actions directly to the user's verified ORCID iD.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures secure login, provides unambiguous attribution of submitted methods to the correct researcher, and enables downstream tracking and accreditation (e.g., via APICURON integration at user's discretion).</p>

      <p><strong>What it is:</strong> APICURON is a service designed to track and provide recognition for data curation activities across different databases and resources.</p>
      <p><strong>How DOME Registry integrates:</strong> By linking submitted machine learning method entries to the submitter's ORCID iD (via the required sign-in process), the DOME Registry enables services like APICURON to recognize and aggregate these curation contributions.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This integration facilitates formal accreditation for the often-unrecognized effort involved in meticulously describing and curating scientific methods, attributing this work directly to the individual curator's ORCID profile.</p>

      <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Bioschemas is a community initiative developing lightweight semantic annotations (markup) for life science websites, making their content more discoverable by search engines and interoperable for machines. It extends the broader Schema.org vocabulary for biological and biomedical resources.</p>
      <p><strong>How DOME Registry integrates:</strong> The DOME Registry embeds Bioschemas markup within its web pages that display method entries. This structured metadata describes the method and its components in a machine-readable JSON-LD format.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Using Bioschemas significantly improves the Findability and Interoperability of methods within the DOME Registry. Search engines can better understand and index the content, and other computational tools can more easily parse and integrate information about the methods described.</p>

    <div class="implementation-text">
      <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The DOME Wizard is the primary tool used by researchers to submit their method descriptions to the DOME Registry. It is built upon the framework of the Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW), an open-source platform for creating smart questionnaires designed to guide users in creating FAIR data management plans and other structured documents.</p>
      <p><strong>How DOME integrates:</strong> We have customized the DSW framework to specifically implement the DOME Recommendations. The DOME Wizard presents users with a guided, question-and-answer interface that prompts them for all the necessary information fields outlined in the DOME Recommendations.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The DOME Wizard simplifies the submission process, ensures that entries are structured consistently according to the DOME Recommendations, captures essential metadata, and lowers the barrier for creating high-quality, detailed method descriptions.</p>

      <p><strong>What it is:</strong> FAIRsharing is a curated, informative, and educational resource cataloging data and metadata standards, databases, and data policies across various scientific disciplines. It helps researchers, funders, journals, and developers discover, select, and implement appropriate community standards.</p>
      <p><strong>How DOME integrates/relates:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DOME Registry Listing:</strong> The DOME Registry itself is described and listed within FAIRsharing as a database resource dedicated to ML methods.</p>
      <p><strong>DOME Recommendations Listing:</strong> The DOME Recommendations are described and listed within FAIRsharing as a community standard for describing ML methods.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Listing DOME resources in FAIRsharing increases their Findability and visibility within the standards landscape. It also positions DOME within the ecosystem of resources promoting FAIR data practices and provides a valuable lookup service for DOME users needing to reference other standards.</p>

      <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Identifiers.org is a central resolving system that provides persistent, location-independent identifiers for data resources in the life sciences and beyond. It allows users to reliably link to databases, ontologies, software tools, and other entities using compact identifiers (CURIEs, e.g., pubmed:123456).</p>
      <p><strong>How DOME integrates:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DOME Registry Identifiers:</strong> The persistent identifiers assigned to method entries within the DOME Registry itself are registered with Identifiers.org, allowing them to be resolved universally through its system.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Utilizing Identifiers.org enhances the Interoperability and Reusability of DOME entries by providing stable, resolvable links to the components and context of the described method. It standardizes how external resources are referenced.</p>

      <p><strong>What it is:</strong> LS Login is an Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure (AAI) service, part of the EOSC LS-RI ecosystem, enabling users to securely access various life science web services using their institutional credentials or other linked accounts (like ORCID).</p>
      <p><strong>How DOME integrates:</strong> User authentication for accessing the DOME Wizard (the submission tool) is handled via LS Login. Users can choose to log in through the LS Login portal before they can create or edit method descriptions within the Wizard.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides a secure, federated login system, often allowing users to use familiar institutional credentials (Single Sign-On). Streamlines access to the submission tool without needing separate DOME Wizard credentials.</p>
